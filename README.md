# About

Hello world :earth_asia:! Are you an economist, or economics student, or just a random person like me who is interested in economics? Do you want to write a paper, a thesis, or just ramble on some stuffs but don't have any fresh ideas on what should be the topic? Worry no more! Because, this repository is for you!

Before jumping in, consider this:

```
As of this writing, there are more than 20,000 working papers on NBER. If getting one paper takes around 30 seconds (including the required time interval imposed by NBER in its crawler policy, it takes more than a week to finish the program.
```

If you are okay with above caution, you may want to use [Heroku](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-postgresql) or other cloud service so that the program won't run on your local machine. If yes, you may need to spare $9/month to maintain the PostgreSQL database because its free edition only covers up to 10,000 rows. If you are okay with this, you may go on. However, I won't get into setting up database on Heroku since in this repository I only run on my local machine.

# Virtual environment

It's not an obligation to use a virtual environment, but using it is better (I think) for a good reason. This project has dependencies on third-party modules such as `pandas`, `requests`. Some of these modules may be updated and have consequences to the project. Or maybe you have another project with the same modules but different versions. Using virtual environment will tackle all of the issues. Just run the following on terminal:

```
python3 -m venv .venv-nber
source .venv-nber/bin/activate
```

# Install requirements

As mentioned above, this project depends on third-party modules. Run the following on terminal to install them on your machine:

```
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

# PostgreSQL

Install: [link](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

Connect to localhost:

```
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -d postgres
```

Then input your password when it prompts something like this:

```
Password for user postgres: 
```

However, it may be different if you have different configurations.

To create table, run the SQL query in `util/get_paper.sql`

# Run

Run the Python script on terminal:

```
python3 src/get_paper.py
```

It will prompt you questions:

```
Your PostgreSQL username: [YOUR POSTGRESQL USERNAME]
Your PostgreSQL password: [YOUR POSTGRESQL PASSWORD]
Your PostgreSQL host: [YOUR POSTGRESQL HOST]
Your PostgreSQL port: [YOUR POSTGRESQL PORT]
Your PostgreSQL database: [YOUR POSTGRESQL DATABASE]
Input initial ID: [PRESS 0 IF YOU WANT TO START FROM https://www.nber.org/papers/w0000] 
```

# Test

Run unit tests to ensure the data quality is good.

```
pytest test -s
```

It then will prompt you to input your PostgreSQL password:

```
collecting ... Your PostgreSQL password: 
```

# Columns

|column_name|data_type|description|
|-|-|-|
|id|int4|A unique ID for each paper|
|citation_title|varchar|Paper title|
|citation_author|varchar|Paper author(s). Can be more than one. Hence it is stored as an array|
|citation_date|date|Date of paper (not clear)|
|citation_publication_date|date|Date of paper being published|
|citation_technical_report_institution|varchar|Institution which publishes the report|
|citation_technical_report_number|varchar|Paper ID as in the website|
|citation_journal_title|varchar|Journal title|
|citation_journal_issn|varchar|ISSN number|
|citation_pdf_url|varchar|Paper URL for PDF version|
|topics|varchar|Paper topic(s). Can be more tan one. Hence it is stored as an array|
|abstract|varchar|Paper abstract|
|also_downloaded|varchar|Users who downloaded this paper also downloaded* these. Can be more than one. Hence it is stored as an array. The reason I use the URL because otherwise it won't catch other than the working papers. Users may also download something from `/chapters/`, which may be useful for analysis|
|cited|varchar|A list of papers which cited the NBER paper. It is obtained from http://citec.repec.org/|
|reference|varchar|A list of reference papers for each NBER paper. It is obtained from http://citec.repec.org/|

# Explore

Play around with the SQL queries inside `util/explore.sql`, for example:

```
SELECT topics, COUNT(*)
FROM (
	SELECT UNNEST(topics) AS topics
	FROM paper
) AS paper
WHERE topics != ''
GROUP BY topics
ORDER BY topics ASC;
```

...and the output will be:


```
                         topics                         | count
